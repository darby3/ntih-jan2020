My name is Darby. I'm a web designer/developer by day and I do other stuff with the rest of my time.

_Naming Things is Hard_ is my technical blog, mostly here for incredibly sporadic web development and design content.

I'm really bad at keeping this page up to date so [I will just point you toward this site](https://chickenwing-gingerbreadman.xyz/). There, you'll find links to all my stuff all over the place, including various social media links, where you can go to yell at me about how wrong I am about literally whatever.
