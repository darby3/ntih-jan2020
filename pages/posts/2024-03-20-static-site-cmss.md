I've got two blogs hosted on Netlify using 11ty-based blogging systems—this one, which I generally [brewed up myself](https://github.com/darby3/ntih-jan2020) using 11ty, and then my [book blog site](https://tdaoc.org/), which I recently revamped using [11ty-base-blog](https://eleventy-base-blog.netlify.app/). 

I don't update either enough, which is fine, I'm busy, but when I do, it sure is nice to have an interface to my content that doesn't require me to load up my code editor and directly interact with my files. To that end I use two separate versions of something that, once upon a time, was called Netlify CMS; for this site I use [Static CMS](https://www.staticcms.org/), which forked off Netlify CMS a while back when it looked like Netlify CMS was dying on the vine, and for the book blog site, which I set back up sometime last year, I use [Decap CMS](https://decapcms.org/), which is what Netlify CMS officially “became" when Netlify decided to officially not do it anymore.
