I love static sites, but doing a blog as a static site (as this one is) has long come with the pitfall that I don't actually use it much, because of how all the content files are in the code repo, and that means either _needing_ to do all my content entry directly into the repo, or going out to the repo on Github and manually adding files, or whatever. If only there was a way to manage the content as if it were a unique part of the system…

Enter [Static CMS](https://www.staticcms.org/)! Which is actually a fork of Netlify CMS, a project which I knew about but which I'd never looked into, as I'd mistakenly assumed it was some kind of premium database-driven back-end _thing_, which it turns out it is not, nor is Static CMS: instead, these are basically basic web apps that present an admin interface for manipulating the content files in the repo, directly, no database or whatever system required.

And…it's pretty slick. I have some things I want to try upgrading, but as a concept—as a way to make “content entry” feel like actual _content entry_—it's all there. Hopefully the project keeps its momentum going (and hopefully I find some blogging momentum in using it).
