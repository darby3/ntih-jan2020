When [I last wrote about this](https://namingthingsishard.blog/posts/2024-03-20-static-site-cmss/), there were two really good options for what I was looking for. Now there's only one, as [Static CMS has been discontinued](https://github.com/StaticJsCMS/static-cms).

I'm bummed out about this, because Static CMS continued to have the better overall interface, and while I've tamed the Decap CMS interface a bit via [the kind of thing you find when you dig through the issue queue](https://github.com/decaporg/decap-cms/issues/441#issuecomment-1666691035), it's still not _quite_ as good. Which, again, is a bummer.

But! Not the end of the world. I'm using Decap over on [another blog of mine that I've been starting up recently](https://blog.chickenwing-gingerbreadman.xyz/), and it does work. I do wish the mobile interface kicked more butt, even with the hack styles implemented; it does seem like there's active work on the UI going on now, which is great. I'm holding on to see what's coming.
