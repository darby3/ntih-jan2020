I've been thinking about web components and I haven't been understanding web components and then today I listened to [The Vanilla JS Podcast's “The elevator pitch for web components” episode](https://vanillajspodcast.com/the-elevator-pitch-for-web-components/) and then I got several links deep into [the related blog post](https://gomakethings.com/the-elevator-pitch-for-web-components/) and now I'm staring at a mildly custom little thing I need to insert into a specific point in one page in a CMS and I'm like, oh, wait, wait, maybe I don't have to sit here manually editing and reloading this page in the CMS over and over again to get this to work. Maybe I can web componentize this, work on the JS interactivity part separately, and just reload the related page until its working the way I expect. Or am I thinking about this the wrong way, still? Do I have time to figure it out? Let's find out!
