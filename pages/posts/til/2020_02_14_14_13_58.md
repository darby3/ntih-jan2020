[This video came out in November](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZS-7RX_c7g), but I just saw it for the first time. In it, Jen Simmons gives a quick overview of three new css properties:

- ```text-underline-offset```
- ```text-decoration-thickness```
- ```text-decoration-skip-ink```

Support isn't _super_ great cross-browser yet. But I love the possibilities for what can be done here!
