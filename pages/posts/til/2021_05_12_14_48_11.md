I know for sure there's a whole bunch of `console` stuff I don't use. But now I know about `console.group()` and `console.groupCollapsed()`, which absolutely delight me; there's a non-trivial number of times in my life when I've `console.log()`ing something about absurd numbers of things on a given page. The above methods give me a handy way to tame that output so it's a shade more useful.
