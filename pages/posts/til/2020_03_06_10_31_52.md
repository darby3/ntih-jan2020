I have blocks placed into regions in Drupal 7 usi!ng the [Context module](https://www.drupal.org/project/context). For the most part it’s fine that all those blocks get rendered and printed at the page.tpl.php level, but, sometimes, I want to render them inside node.tpl.php, because I want to place things more specifically within the flow of node-level content. But, the ```block_get_blocks_by_region``` function doesn’t give me the blocks I need, because context is kind of off working in its own lane.

Once I figured that out, I figured there must be a way to manually get what I needed via the context module. [This bit right here](https://www.drupal.org/project/context/issues/1306172#comment-8458537) is the bit I needed to do that.
