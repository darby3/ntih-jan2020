I'm working on some clean-up here, fixing some things and rearranging some furniture that's been bothering me for a while. To that end I suspect lots of links are going to break and the RSS feed is going to probably vomit all over the place for a bit. I apologize in advance. Should be a one-time thing. (I hope.)
