I'm slowly poking away at under-the-hood tech for my web presence and one thing I've been working on is getting styling for this site tamed; as part of that, rather than just having a style sheet I sweep junk into every time I need to make a minor (or major) change, I've got a sort of ramshackle style system or personal pattern library going on. It's not perfect yet but it's generally tamed how my design is set up, and provides at least a semi-rational baseline for keeping things somewhat in order. It started with a new design for [my personal blog](https://blog.chickenwing-gingerbreadman.xyz/) which I then realized a bit later I could use to lasso in my other blogs, and, so, with some hacks and some scrapes, I've got a new coat of paint drying [over on my litblog](https://tdaoc.org/). It's not quite where I want it all yet, and I'm still making liberal use of a "hacks.css" file, as I slowly sort out my own personal workflow, here, but...I like where it's going. Next up is to get [this blog](https://namingthingsishard.blog/) into the fold and then...I guess I take over the world or something?
