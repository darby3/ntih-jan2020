Anyways, hello, if you’re still out there in feed-reader land.

It’s been quiet here but I think maybe I finally have an idea or two of what to actually, like, *do*, here. Which could be a lot of fun if you’re into whatever my dumb idea of fun is.

In the meantime I am—for varying degrees of “am”—out there other places still, which [you can find here](https://chickenwing-gingerbreadman.xyz/). Feel free to shout at me if you like.
