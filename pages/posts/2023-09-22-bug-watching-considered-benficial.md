Did you know you can kind of watch browsers be developed? It's true! Like once upon a time I subscribed to [this "bug" against Firefox](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=418039) in [Mozilla's Bugzilla site](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/home) and ever since then I've been getting notification bits in my inbox about this dependency or that blocked issue as they've trickled out and it's just enough to remind me that this new feature I'm really interested in is definitely being worked on and is certainly coming, someday, probably. It's kind of cool.

You can also of course file bugs against browsers. Which is how I know that [this incredibly weird and obscure bug I filed against Safari](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=256047)â€¦does not appear to be definitely being worked on. But hey! Maybe someday!
