I kind of just said, aw, screw it, and just pointed the URL at Netlify. I mean, part of me is, honestly, like, why do I need a service to do this one silly let step for me, what's wrong with SFTP, come on, right? And then the other part of me is like: look, me, be lazy, it's okay.

So here we are. I'm lazy now. 

I'm also not _done_ with any of this but for now it's fine _enough_ and I'm probably the only person looking at this anyway so _like, whatever, man_.
