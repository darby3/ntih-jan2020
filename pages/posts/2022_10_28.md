First, I've been thinking about how I should figure out a way to post to this blog without *needing* to open up the repo locally; I really like the way I have this set up and all, but that's been kind of a blocker. Then I got to wondering if I could just duplicate a file on the Github website and edit it directly. Which lead me to the fact that *they put VS Code in the browser*, which is ridiculous, but, okay, here we are. This might work.

Second, I just dropped a new Link of Note for the first time in forever, which immediately reminded me that I broke the templates for Link of Note and Today I Learned posts, when I was last messing with the design of this site. So those look weird. Maybe I'll find some time in the next year to fix them. I think there was more I wanted to do with them. Maybe. I don't know!
