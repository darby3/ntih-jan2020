If I haven't made it obvious, I love CSS Grid. I'm using it for just about everything these days, starting with layout and working down to the point where it makes more sense to switch to flexbox (wherever that point may be).

One issue I've run into lately is that content wider than a preferred CSS grid column width can act, from my perspective, irresponsibly. Turns out there's reasons for that, and they're fairly easily addressed.
